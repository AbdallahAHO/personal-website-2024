Big ideas often start small—just a fleeting thought that catches your attention. Escalay is my space for those moments.

The word “Escalay” comes from the Nubian language, meaning "waterwheel." It’s a tribute to my [Nubian](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Nubians) roots, reflecting how ideas flow and evolve, much like a waterwheel generating energy. It’s also inspired by [Hamza El Din](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Hamza_El_Din)'s beautiful piece "Escalay (The Water Wheel)," which captures the essence of continuous creative movement.

### What is Escalay?

Escalay is my side project under **escalay.space**. It’s a place where I experiment, play around, and work on small ideas without constraints. Sometimes it’s brainstorming a new feature, exploring growth strategies, or just tinkering for fun—Escalay is my creative sandbox.

There’s no set structure here. Some ideas might grow into something big, while others stay small, and that’s okay. Escalay is an interface for everything I do—a starting point for ideas that could eventually lead to larger projects.

### Why Have a Space Like This?

Why bother creating a dedicated space for experimentation? Honestly, having a place just for experimenting helps a lot. Sometimes you need to try things out to see if they're worth pursuing. And let’s be real, the whole process—finding a domain, setting things up, and dealing with all the chaos—is part of the fun before an idea becomes something real. Escalay helps me think freely and refine ideas until they make sense.

I focus a lot on product-led growth—building features that users love and that make the product valuable on its own. Escalay lets me prototype and play around with those concepts: How can onboarding be more engaging? How can a feature naturally encourage users to share it? These are the kinds of challenges I tackle here.

### What Comes Out of Escalay?

Escalay is still a new idea, but I see it as a place that can help me take small experiments and expand them into full-fledged projects. It has helped me shape new features and think through engagement strategies. It’s where I can test how AI might fit naturally into workflows or how to make users feel more connected to a product. Not every idea from Escalay will grow into something big, but it's a valuable space to explore and refine what really matters.

Ultimately, Escalay is about keeping things moving—letting ideas flow and seeing which ones have potential to grow into something bigger. If you have an idea you're unsure about, sometimes giving it the space to grow can make all the difference. You never know where it might lead.

Thanks for reading, and stay tuned—there’s always more to explore.
