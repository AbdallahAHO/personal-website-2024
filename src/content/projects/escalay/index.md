You know how big ideas often start as tiny, random thoughts? Well, Escalay is where I stash those.

“Escalay” means "waterwheel" in Nubian—shoutout to my [Nubian](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Nubians) roots. It captures how ideas spin and flow, much like a waterwheel generating energy. I got the name, listening to [Hamza El Din](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Hamza_El_Din)'s "Escalay (The Water Wheel)." piece, for probably the hundredth time. Give it a listen—it's all about continuous creative movement.

### What is Escalay?

Escalay is my side project over at **escalay.space**. It's basically my sandbox where I can tinker without rules. Sometimes I'm brainstorming a new feature; other times, I'm just messing around. No structure, no pressure.

Some ideas might take off; others might not—and that's fine. It's like the test kitchen for everything I do—a starting point that could turn into something bigger.

### Why Have a Space Like This?

Why set up a whole space just to experiment? Because sometimes you gotta try stuff out to see if it's worth the hassle. And let's face it, the initial chaos—grabbing a domain, setting things up—is half the fun before an idea gets serious. Escalay lets me play around until things start making sense.

I'm big on product-led growth—building stuff people actually want to use. Escalay lets me toy with that: making onboarding less boring, features more shareable, all that jazz.

### So, What's Coming Out of This?

Escalay helps me turn little experiments into real projects. It's where I cook up new features, think about engagement strategies, figure out where AI fits in (without forcing it in), or just make things that connect with users. Not every idea will be a blockbuster, but that's kind of the point.

At the end of the day, Escalay is about keeping ideas flowing and seeing what sticks. Got a half-baked concept? Give it some space—you never know where it might lead.

Thanks for stopping by, and stay tuned—there's always more in the works.
