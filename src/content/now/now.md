Still living in Winterhude, Hamburg—six years in and still loyal to the rhythm of Hayns Park walks and slow evenings by Stadtpark. It’s home.

I’m working remotely at Lokalise, focusing on frontend and Growth Engineering. Lately, I’ve been diving deep into micro SaaS development, aiming to ship one solid tool every month throughout 2026. No fluff — just focused, finished products that solve smaller but real problems. 

Also still very much into LLMs and practical AI. Been exploring how they can power real-world tools—especially ones tailored to Arabic-speaking markets and family-oriented workflows. and new OpenAI GPT-4o image generation is so fun! unlocked a lot of fun ideas.

On the music front, Attended couple of great concerts lately, especially [Ibrahim Maalouf's performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYdaRq2MS8I) Trumpets of Michel-Ange at the Elbphilharmonie, and Seeing [Souad Massi live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYkmm-tiyyc&t=4267s) finally in Hamburg.

#### Current Focus

This year is about execution. Less ideation, more shipping. I’m refining a system to crank out micro SaaS projects fast—one per month—starting with internal tools I’ve already tested in my own workflows.

Also gearing up to wrap some personal-life project this summer, so there’s a lot of emotional and logistical energy going into building a life, not just products.

Let’s see how much I can actually finish before the year’s out.
