# What am I doing now

I'm still living in Free Hanseatic Hamburg. It's been my home for the past 6 years, and I'm still enjoying the nearby Hayns and Stadt Park.

I'm working at Lokalise as a Growth Engineer. Lately, I've been focusing on LLMs and building apps with it. I'm particularly excited about the new [OpenAI Realtime API](https://openai.com/index/introducing-the-realtime-api/).

Lately, I've been listening to a lot of Moroccan Folk music ([Gnawa](https://open.spotify.com/track/4g0iZEHzfxbYZ5JDPREUDs?si=db2471cf4bc842ff) to be more specific) and Modern Middle Eastern Jazz ([Faraj Suleiman](https://open.spotify.com/track/2haduuaSMHdj6UE39Fbwb6?si=5e06a023ac224c5f) is Awesome).

#### Current Focus

Shipping stuff out of the door, I've decided this year and the coming one will be more about finishing things rather than starting them. Doing it in Public helps me stay aligned with my goals and make intentional decisions about my time and energy.

For a start getting my personal website out is crossed of my TODO list.
