# What am I doing now

Still hanging out in Free Hanseatic Hamburg. Been calling it home for six years now, and I'm still loving the nearby Hayns and Stadt Park—can't complain.

Working remotely at Lokalise as a Growth Engineer. Lately, I've been nerding out over LLMs and exploring building apps with them. Pretty excited about the new [OpenAI Realtime API](https://openai.com/index/introducing-the-realtime-api/). Great stuff!

On the music front, I've been really into Moroccan Folk music (Gnawa , to be specific) and Modern Middle Eastern Jazz—Faraj Suleiman is absolutely killing it.

#### Current Focus

This year's all about actually finishing things instead of just starting them. Novel concept, right? Shipping stuff out the door. Doing it publicly keeps me accountable and forces me to be intentional with my time and energy.

First up, I finally crossed "get personal website up" off my TODO list. Progress!
