My first job in Germany was with ABOUT YOU, a leading fashion company in Europe. I joined the Checkout team, which included almost 15 different nationalitiesâ€”making every day exciting and full of new perspectives.

It was my first step into e-commerce, and being part of such a diverse group was eye-opening. I worked on features that helped expand the store across four European countries, rolling out new payment methods, custom checkout flows, and store-issued gift cards. I also built a universal tracking solution to improve the checkout process and ease future development. Though my time there was short, it left a big mark on me and set the foundation for everything I've done since in tech.
