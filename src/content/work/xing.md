At XING, the largest professional network in German-speaking countries, I first got into Growth Engineering. Joining the Growth team as a Frontend Engineer, I was fascinated by running experiments and seeing how users reacted—it was more than just shipping features. During my time in Growth team, I reimagined the onboarding process, boosting premium sign-ups.

Later, as a Senior Engineer, Worked with core teams responsible for profiles and networking; I streamlined workflows for the team. I also mentored junior engineers, which was incredibly rewarding. My time at XING was about more than writing code—it was about making a product that users loved and building a culture of growth and collaboration.
