At Postman, I joined a newly formed Growth team as the Technical Lead, helping build everything from the ground up. As the Technical Lead, I launched collection templates that saw 45,000 imports in three months, making onboarding smoother and more valuable for users.

I also developed LLM-powered features to auto-generate collections from code, making the platform more engaging for new users. I streamlined A/B testing and mentored junior engineers, strengthening the team's efficiency and cohesion. It was an experience full of problem-solving, mentorship, and building something impactful.
