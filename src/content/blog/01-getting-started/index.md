Hey there! Welcome to my little corner of the web—where I get to overshare my working in Tech, Hamburg, and life (with a sprinkle of fun).

As a Egyptian Senior Software Engineer based in Hamburg, Germany. My journey from Egypt to Germany has been about working with global team, building amazing products and navigating multicultural environments. This blog is my way to keep exploring, experimenting, and sharing with the community.

### Why This Blog?
I've spent years shipping, tinkering and working with different technologies. This journey has been about mastering both technical skills and softer skills like communication and leadership. I want to use this blog to share insights, document my learnings, and contribute to the developer community.

You'll find posts on building scalable software, leadership in tech, and the intersection of culture, language, and technology—perspectives shaped by my background in English (Maybe, Arabic).

### What Can You Expect?
Upcoming posts will cover:

- **Growth Engineering and Product-Led Growth**: Leveraging AI to drive user engagement and seamless product experiences.
- **Technical Deep Dives**: Insights on frontend, growth engineering, LLMs and AI and real-world implementations.
- **Building a Tech Career**: Tips on navigating career paths and finding your niche.
- **Life Outside Code Editors**: My interests in music, food, and exploring different cultures.

If you enjoy discussions on software engineering, technology, or just want to follow along, I hope you'll find value here.
